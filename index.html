		<h1>Kiki Cralle</h1>
		<p>Female German Shepherd | Professional Stick Athlete & Beloved Companion</p>

		<h2>Personal Information</h2>
		<h3>Gender:</h3>
		<p>Female</p>
		<h3>Birthday:</h3>
		<p>February 3, 2016</p>
		<h3>Lifespan:</h3>
		<p>9 years (Passed on August 14, 2025)</p>
		<h3>Origin</h3>
		<p>Breeder in South Carolina; brought home by her loving family</p>
		<h3>Specialty:</h3>
		<p>Stick enthusiast, laser chaser, people-watching professional, and trick master</p>

		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>To spread joy, laughter, and unconditional love while proudly serving as the household’s best friend, guard, entertainer, and recruiter of new stick-throwers.</p>

		<h2>Core Skills & Talents</h2>
		<h3>Stick Mastery:</h3>
		<p>Devoted to both her orange and blue rubber sticks. Could run across entire fields with lightning speed, often rolling dramatically in her pursuit.</p>
		<h3>Paw-Shove Precision:</h3>
		<p>Expert at dribbling her stick, nudging and shoving it with her paw so it rolled far away — always landing exactly where she wanted it, like she set up her own next play.</p>
		<h3>Laser Acrobatics:</h3>
		<p>Chased red dots with cat-like pounces, spins, and somersault-level energy (despite occasional self-inflicted collisions).</p>
		<h3>Balloon Booping:</h3>
		<p>Expert at leaping and nose-tapping balloons mid-air.</p>
		<h3>Window Watcher</h3>
		<p>Skilled people-watcher from her day-bed throne, keeping the street in check.</p>
		<h3>Front-Door Alarm Specialist:</h3>
		<p>Barked at anyone approaching the front door — mailman, family, Chanti — always ready to announce arrivals and defend her territory.</p>
		<h3>Guest Relations Specialist:</h3>
		<p>Though not a cuddler with family, she became affectionate when visitors arrived — plopping on the bed, hanging out, even napping beside them — mostly because she recognized them as fresh recruits for stick duty. Sometimes her excitement was so intense she would happy-pee, proving just how overjoyed she was to meet new throwers.</p>
		<h3>Sirens & Family Chorus:</h3>
		<p>The only time she ever howled was when ambulance sirens sounded or when her human family joined in — always chiming in to add her voice to the collective howl.</p>
		<h3>Cognitive & Trick Mastery:</h3>
		<p>Highly intelligent and obedient. Could perform:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shake / Other Hand</li>
				<li>Sit, Down, Roll Over, Speak, Stay (balancing treats on her head/muzzle for extended periods)</li>
				<li>Okay (release command)</li>
				<li>Up (stands and puts front paws on you)</li>
				<li>Touch (boops hand or nearby object)</li>
				<li>Back (continues backing up indefinitely on command)</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Selective Socializing:</h3>
		<p>Barking enthusiast when encountering small white dogs, but loyal companion to her beloved boyfriend Oreo (neighbor’s scruffy pup).</p>
		<h3>Independent Spirit:</h3>
		<p>Usually showed affection only when it advanced her stick agenda, but always on her own terms.</p>
		<h3>Low Maintenance & Beach Enthusiast:</h3>
		<p>Hated baths, but loved running along the beach — especially if a stick was involved. Shed enough to avoid frequent grooming.</p>

		<h2>Favorite Things</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Snacks: Bananas, apples, peanut butter, and ice cubes.</li>
				<li>Playthings: Orange stick, blue stick, balloons, laser dot, and any throwable stick at the beach.</li>
				<li>Friends: Oreo (true love), Romeo (friendly acquaintance), and her human family.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Achievements</h2>

				<li>Invented her own games by paw-shoving her stick across the yard like a pro.</li>
				<li>Outsmarted her family by saving rare displays of affection for guests, ensuring new throwers were always lined up.</li>
				<li>Protected her home with unmatched vigilance — every approach to the front door was met with a full-throttle bark.</li>
				<li>Contributed to family sing-alongs during siren emergencies, showing off her impeccable howl timing.</li>
				<li>Lived bravely with a condition that slowly weakened her back legs, adapting first with determination and later with her wheelchair for walks.</li>
				<li>Left this world after a final battle with her adventurous sock-eating ways — a choice made with love to let her rest, at just the right time.</li>
			</ul>
