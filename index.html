		<h2>Personal Information</h2>
		<p><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</p>
		<p><strong>Birthday:</strong> February 3, 2016</p>
		<p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> 9 years (Passed on August 14, 2025)</p>
		<p><strong>Origin</strong> Breeder in 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina" target="_blank">South Carolina</a>; brought home by her loving family</p>
		<p><strong>Specialty:</strong> Stick enthusiast, laser chaser, people-watching professional, and trick master</p>

		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>To spread joy, laughter, and unconditional love while proudly serving as the household’s best friend, guard, entertainer, and recruiter of new stick-throwers.</p>

		<h2>Core Skills & Talents</h2>
			<ul>
			    <li><strong>Stick Mastery:</strong> Devoted to both her orange and blue rubber sticks. Could run across entire fields with lightning speed, often rolling dramatically in her pursuit.</li>
			    <li><strong>Paw-Shove Precision:</strong> Expert at dribbling her stick, nudging and shoving it with her paw so it rolled far away — always landing exactly where she wanted it, like she set up her own next play.</li>
			    <li><strong>Laser Acrobatics:</strong> Chased red dots with cat-like pounces, spins, and somersault-level energy (despite occasional self-inflicted collisions).</li>
			    <li><strong>Balloon Booping:</strong> Expert at leaping and nose-tapping balloons mid-air.</li>
			    <li><strong>Window Watcher:</strong> Skilled people-watcher from her day-bed throne, keeping the street in check.</li>
			    <li><strong>Front-Door Alarm Specialist:</strong> Barked at anyone approaching the front door — mailman, family, Chanti — always ready to announce arrivals and defend her territory.</li>
			    <li><strong>Guest Relations Specialist:</strong> Though not a cuddler with family, she became affectionate when visitors arrived — plopping on the bed, hanging out, even napping beside them — mostly because she recognized them as fresh recruits for stick duty. Sometimes her excitement was so intense she would happy-pee, proving just how overjoyed she was to meet new throwers.</li>
			    <li><strong>Sirens & Family Chorus:</strong> The only time she ever howled was when ambulance sirens sounded or when her human family joined in — always chiming in to add her voice to the collective howl.</li>
			    <li><strong>Cognitive & Trick Mastery:</strong> Highly intelligent and obedient. Could perform:
			        <ul>
			            <li>Shake / Other Hand</li>
			            <li>Sit, Down, Roll Over, Speak, Stay (balancing treats on her head/muzzle for extended periods)</li>
			            <li>Okay (release command)</li>
			            <li>Up (stands and puts front paws on you)</li>
			            <li>Touch (boops hand or nearby object)</li>
			            <li>Back (continues backing up indefinitely on command)</li>
			        </ul>
			    </li>
			    <li><strong>Selective Socializing:</strong> Barking enthusiast when encountering small white dogs, but loyal companion to her beloved boyfriend Oreo (neighbor’s scruffy pup).</li>
			    <li><strong>Independent Spirit:</strong> Usually showed affection only when it advanced her stick agenda, but always on her own terms.</li>
			    <li><strong>Low Maintenance & Beach Enthusiast:</strong> Hated baths, but loved running along the beach — especially if a stick was involved. Shed enough to avoid frequent grooming.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Favorite Things</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Snacks: Bananas, apples, peanut butter, and ice cubes.</li>
				<li>Playthings: Orange stick, blue stick, balloons, laser dot, and any throwable stick at the beach.</li>
				<li>Friends: Oreo (true love), Romeo (friendly acquaintance), and her human family.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Achievements</h2>

				<li>Outsmarted her family by saving rare displays of affection for guests, ensuring new throwers were always lined up.</li>
				<li>Protected her home with unmatched vigilance — every approach to the front door was met with a full-throttle bark.</li>
				<li>Contributed to family sing-alongs during siren emergencies, showing off her impeccable howl timing.</li>
				<li>Lived bravely with a condition that slowly weakened her back legs, adapting first with determination and later with her wheelchair for walks.</li>
				<li>Left this world after a final battle with her adventurous sock-eating ways — a choice made with love to let her rest, at just the right time.</li>
